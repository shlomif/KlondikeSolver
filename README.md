KlondikeSolver-Old
==================

(*old version) Klondike Solitaire solver to find minimal solutions using IDA*.

I'm in the process of rewriting this solver to be more robust. And will add a link to the new source shortly.

So far I have found a few minor issues that do not produce minimal solutions in the old solver
that I have fixed in the new one. The new solver also has the ability to find minimal solutions for draw counts > 1.
